You must configure the CLI before using

 1- Set your PATH variable:
 ``` bash 
 $ export PATH=<path-to-confluent>/bin:${PATH};
 ```
 2- Optional: Specify a custom location to store the CLI data and logs. By default the Confluent CLI stores its data and logs in your platformâ€™s temporary directory.
 You can check the current data and log location with the confluent `current` command.
 ``` bash
 $ confluent current # /tmp/confluent.gupKDQKn
 ``` 
 # 
  if you wanted to change this location  you should : 
  
  Create a directory:
  ``` bash 
  $ mkdir <path-to-confluent>/var
  ```
  Set the path to your directory:
  ``` bash
  $ export CONFLUENT_CURRENT=<path-to-confluent>/var
  ```
